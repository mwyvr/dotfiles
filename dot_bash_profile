# .bash_profile for Void Linux (and others)
#
# Non-bash related setup (i.e. PATH, env variables and functions to be
# available in any shell) should be defined in either a user ~/.profile or the
# system /etc/profile.
#
# When invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell
# with the --login option, Bash reads and executes commands from the first file
# (if any exist) found in the following order:
#
#   /etc/profile
#   ~/.bash_profile
#   ~/.bash_login
#   ~/.profile
#
# Because of this read-only-the-first behaviour, we include ~/.profile.
#
# When invoked as an interactive non-login shell, such as a terminal window
# within Gnome, Bash reads and executes ~/.bashrc.

# Paths and variables, not specific to bash or any other shell
[ -f "$HOME/.profile" ] && . "$HOME/.profile"

# Source for our aliases and functions
[ -f $HOME/.bashrc ] && . $HOME/.bashrc
