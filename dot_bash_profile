# .bash_profile
# When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, 
# or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, 
# it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, 
# if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks 
# for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, 
# in that order, and reads and executes commands from 
# the first one that exists and is readable. 
#
#
# Paths and variables, not specific to bash
[ -f "$HOME/.profile" ] && . "$HOME/.profile"
# Get the aliases and functions
[ -f $HOME/.bashrc ] && . $HOME/.bashrc
