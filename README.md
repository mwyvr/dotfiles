# dotfiles

This repo contains my "dotfile" configuration files, managed by [chezmoi]
(https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/), which makes managing personal
configuration files across multiple machines and distributions a ~~little~~
**lot** easier.

You'll find chezmoi template files managing various distro-specific
customizations (Chimera Linux, Void Linux, openSUSE MicroOS, Aeon Desktop from
openSUSE, openSUSE Tumbleweed, and Arch) in shell (sh, bash, fish) configs and
script files.

Old `dwm` and `dwl` configs still live in here, but since mid-2023 I've been
all-in running vanilla GNOME with a few keyboard customizations and the `foot`
terminal.
